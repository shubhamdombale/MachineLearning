This project involves analyzing automobile data to predict car prices using multiple regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. The data is split into training and testing sets, and features are standardized using `StandardScaler`. Linear, Lasso, and Ridge regression models are trained and evaluated, with cross-validation used to assess model performance. A custom function checks for overfitting or underfitting. The Lasso and Ridge models' performance is fine-tuned by iterating over different regularization parameters. Finally, model coefficients are visualized to compare the impact of each feature, and cross-validation scores are analyzed to determine the best model. Lasso regularization is concluded to perform the best based on cross-validation results.
